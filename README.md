# WeightConvertorPython
It is a simple Python program that converts a userâ€™s weight between Kilograms and Pounds. The program first prompts the user to enter their weight as a float and then asks for the unit of measurement (Kilograms or Pounds). The program then checks the unit entered by the user and performs the appropriate conversion. If the unit is Kilograms, the weight is converted to Pounds. If the unit is Pounds, the weight is converted to Kilograms. The converted weight is then printed to the screen. If the unit entered by the user is neither Kilograms nor Pounds, an error message is printed.
